# Uno Project
This is my attempt on creating CLI based UNO game.

## Working
- The program deals 7 card each to 4 players after creating and shuffling the deck.
- Then, a card is turned and shown as previous card.
- The game starts from player 1.
- Player 1 can choose to play a card from his pile.
- Card with same number, color, or ability is permitted.
- Special cards like wild card and +4 can be played anytime.
- Special card prompts the user to specify the color.
- The thrown card is stored in discard pile and latest discard card is the turned card.
- Pulling pile is specified but is not functional currently.
- Repeated by other 3 players similarly.

## Things to Add
- Special condition for +4 and suitable penalty.
- Allow users to pull card from pull pile when no suitable cards to play.
- Let users specify number of players from 2 to 6
- More...

### Finally, attempt to create API and turn it to GUI
